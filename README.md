 - Milestone 2:


 in Milestone 2 a virtual environment is created using Conda an open source package management system and an environment system. After setting up the virtual environment, we run the model created in Milestone 1 into the local machine.
 
 - Milestone 3:
  In this milestone the game Rock-paper-scissors is created.in the first task a python file manual_rps.py is     created to play the game without the camera,and in the file we have two functions:
    -get_computer_choice:
      This function picks randomly the choice between'paper,rock,scissor'by using the random module.The choice      is store to a list variable.
